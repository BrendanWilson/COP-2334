### Instructions

A local pizza shop is selling a large pizza for $14.99. Given the number of
 pizzas to order as input, output the subtotal for the pizzas, and then output
 the total after applying a sales tax of 8%.

Output each floating-point value with two digits after the decimal point using
 the following statement once before all other cout statements:

```cout << fixed << setprecision(2);```

Ex: If the input is:
```3```

the output is:
``` 
Pizzas: 3
Subtotal: $44.97
Total due: $48.57
```
