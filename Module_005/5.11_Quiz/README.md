Question 7

## Goal

 Processing data read from multiple files

### Assignment

You have stored your yearly revenue in multiple files corresponding to
different months. January’s data in january.txt, February’s in february.txt,
and so on. The data for some of the months has gone missing, though.  Write a
code snippet that lets the user enter filenames as console input, and calculates
the average revenue for the months that have not gone missing. The user will
enter "stop" when there are no more files to check. Write the average to the
console. If all the data has gone missing, print 0 to the console.
