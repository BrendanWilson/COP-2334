#### Instructions

Write a program that calculates the balance of a savings account at the end of a
period of time. It should ask the user for the annual interest rate, the starting
balance, and the number of months that have passed since the account was
established. A loop should then iterate once for every month, performing the
following:

A. Ask the user for the amount deposited into the account during the month. (Do
not accept negative numbers.) This amount should be added to the balance.

B. Ask the user for the amount withdrawn from the account during the month. (Do
not accept negative numbers.) This amount should be subtracted from the
balance.

C. Calculate the monthly interest. The monthly interest rate is the annual interest
rate divided by 12. Multiply the monthly interest rate by the balance, and add
the result to the balance.
