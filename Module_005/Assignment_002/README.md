### Instructions

Hotel Occupancy

Write a program that calculates the occupancy rate for a hotel. The program
should start by asking the user how many floors the hotel has. A loop should
then iterate once for each floor. In each iteration, the loop should ask the user
for the number of rooms on the floor and how many of them are occupied. After
all the iterations, the program should display how many rooms the hotel has,
how many of them are occupied, how many are unoccupied, and the percentage
of rooms that are occupied. The percentage may be calculated by dividing the
number of rooms occupied by the number of rooms.
